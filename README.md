# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to build an interactive webpage for users to view data on reported UFO sightings. Users can interact with the data by using the built-in filters that were created using JavaScript and HTML. 

## Results
Using the filters on the webpage is quite simple. As you can see from the following image, there is a spot to enter the criteria you wish to search on.

For instance, you can type "boston" for the city and see if there have been any UFO sightings in Boston, Massachusetts. The criteria must be formatted as shown in the photograph. 

## Summary
One drawback of this design is that users can only search for one criterion of each category at a time. For instance, if someone wanted to search for UFO sightings in Alabama and Arkansas, they would be unable to do so. One addition to this webpage that would improve functionality is if there was a drop down arrow on each slot for users to pick and choose from the data available. Finally, a pop-up calendar for the datetime search box would be helpful as well.
